# Brain Stroke Prediction Web App

This project is a machine learning web application that predicts the risk of brain stroke based on user-provided health data. The application is built with a Python Flask backend and a simple HTML/CSS frontend.

## Features

- **Batch Prediction**: Upload a CSV file with patient data to get stroke risk predictions for multiple individuals at once.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates and displays charts to visualize the relationship between various health factors (age, gender, BMI, smoking status) and stroke risk.
- **Trained Model**: Uses a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.

## Files in this Project

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file that handles web requests, predictions, and visualizations.
- `train_model.py`: The script used to train the machine learning model.
- `stroke_data.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
- `index.html`: The frontend of the web application.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet for the frontend.
- `stroke_model.pkl`: (Generated by `train_model.py`) The saved, pre-trained machine learning model.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask
    ```

3.  **Train the model:**
    Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model and generate the `stroke_model.pkl` file.
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

4.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5.  **Open your browser** and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the application.
